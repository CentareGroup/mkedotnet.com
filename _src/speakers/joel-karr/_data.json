Iâ€™ve been a member of a Big Ten championship college wrestling team and have a speech communications degree along with a MS in computer science and an MBA (all from the University of Illinois). I try to take all the lessons I have learned along the way and help build software teams that write excellent code, and enjoy doing it!</p>",
