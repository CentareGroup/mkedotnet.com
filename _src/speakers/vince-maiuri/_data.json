My professional passion is solving problems for customers, internal and external. I’ve worked for Direct Supply for the last 3 years with various areas of responsibility. I’ve worked with build systems, our eCommerce product, as well as our own internal tooling. Throughout it all I’ve maintained focus on trying to provide my users with the best experience possible. When I’m not working, I enjoy hiking, running, and gaming. Luckily I also enjoy being a father, or I might be bitter that I don’t have much time for any of that other stuff!</p>",
