I’ve also done significant work with SQL Server and Oracle. I’m a Pluralsight author and have presented at community events throughout the Midwest. I try to bring a pragmatic approach to everything I do, making sure the software I build is simple, understandable and balances responsibilities between different components of the system. When speaking or teaching, I emphasize real world scenarios encountered by developers every day and show how to solve them so you can be more effective at what you do.</p>",
