            "<p>What is Site Reliability Engineering (SRE)? Is it hiring a software engineer for a sys admin role or is it more along the lines of emphasizing the Dev in Dev Ops?  Maybe you may have read success stories from Google, Netflix, or Facebook about their SRE programs. Whatever you've heard, Site Reliability Engineering is an emerging and in-demand field that is sweeping through tech companies across the country.</p><p>Site Reliability Engineering is another gift to the world from Google.  Ben Treynor started the first SRE program in 2003 by describing it as “Fundamentally, it’s what happens when you ask a software engineer to design an operations function”.  Join me as we take a deeper look into SRE and why so many companies have started adopting this practice. I will cover its core principles and ideas, along with providing real world examples of things that a typical SRE can see in a day.</p>",
