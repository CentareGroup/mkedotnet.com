        "description": "<p>Code is communication. Between you and the compiler, definitely. But more importantly, code is communication between you and the next developer. Code that communicates poorly is code that cannot be maintained, and code that cannot be maintained is costly.</p><p>In this session, we'll discuss ways to be a better communicator in your code. We'll look at examples of code that might leave you scratching your head, and talk about ways to improve these examples. We'll talk about some principles of effective verbal communication, and look at how these relate to the fundamental principles of writing clean code. </p>",
