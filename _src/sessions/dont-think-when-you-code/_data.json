Before you move along, let me explain.</p><p>By optimizing the way you write code, you will produce more with less effort. Elite athletes learn to react faster than they can consciously think. They do this by identifying situations, then training themselves to respond with a set of actions. You will learn how to become an expert at high-speed decision making. We will also talk about how a “quiet brain” can save you when you are faced with a high pressure situation like production is down! Last, we will talk about how developing a shared mental model with your team can improve communication and simplify design conversations.</p>",
