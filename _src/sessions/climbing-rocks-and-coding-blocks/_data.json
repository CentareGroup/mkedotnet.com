        "description": "<p>Coding can feel as challenging as rock climbing! What do you do after you fall? In this talk, I’ll share how rock climbing taught me better software development practices. Come explore techniques you can try when hanging off a cliff of zeros and ones or need to step away from the ledge of monkey patching. You’ll hear stories of failure as I endeavored to learn to code and how success virtually came from an unlikely source, a rock wall.</p>",
