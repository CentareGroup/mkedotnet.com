        "description": "<p>The stereotype for software developers is that we're bad communicators. That we're all introverts. That we'd rather spend our time interfacing with computers than working with flesh-and-blood humans. Code is logical and predictable. People, by contrast, can feel absolutely chaotic. We're complex, complicated, emotional.</p><p>But software development is an activity performed by people and for people. We have to communicate with humans in myriad ways every day. Improving our communication skills can have a substantial effect on our job performance and satisfaction.</p><p>We'll talk about the importance of good listening and how to get better at it, how to identify and defuse conflict scenarios, and how to level up our influence and persuasiveness.</p>",
