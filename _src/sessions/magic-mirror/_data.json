        "description": "Have you ever heard of a “magic mirror”? And no, I’m not talking about Snow White. I’m talking about a real-world mirror, with smarts… Lend me 60 minutes of your time and I’ll walk you through my experiences of developing my magic mirror. It’s running Windows 10 IoT Core, on a Raspberry Pi 3. It was written in C# as a Universal Windows Platform (UWP) application. My magic mirror boasts facial recognition and the Microsoft Cognitive Services (Emotion APIs), plays music, updates with current local weather and forecasts, displays a clock, and your upcoming aggregated calendar events.",
