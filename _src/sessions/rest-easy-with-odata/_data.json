They can suffer from poor performance and require a lot of custom coding on the client side.</p><p>We'll dig deeper into the RESTful architecture and learn how OData can make it easy to deliver a full featured API with metadata, rich querying syntax, paging, asynchronous batch requests, full CRUD support, collection operations, and optimistic concurrency control.</p><p>Developers, architects, and managers will find this information useful. We will occasionally free dive into some C# code, but will frequently come up for air.</p>",
