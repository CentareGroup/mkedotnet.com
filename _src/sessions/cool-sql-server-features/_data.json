This talk will introduce you to some key features of SQL Server that you might not know about but will definitely want to use once you learn about them. First, we’ll discuss temporal tables, which provide a convenient way to track all of the changes made to data in a table. Second, we’ll talk about the JSON support built into SQL Server 2016 and what capabilities it provides us. Finally, we’ll talk about the windowing functions in SQL Server, which provide powerful analytic capabilities to use against our data. After this talk, you will better appreciate some of the rich functionality built into SQL Server and understand how to put these capabilities to work in the applications you build.</p>",
