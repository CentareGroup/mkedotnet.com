The HoloLens provides a new landscape for us, as developers and innovators, to break new ground with more emerging experiences.</p><p>This discussion will briefly introduce tools for the HoloLens that are often not shown in the videos you may have seen and then spend the majority of time on various developer scenarios. We will go beyond the built in apps, look at the development environment, choices you have and what it is like creating our own apps and games.</p>",
