        "description": "<p>From humble beginnings, JavaScript has gone from a hastily thrown together language for web pages to a hastily thrown together language that runs everywhere. If you can do it with code, you can probably do it in JavaScript. It's the Swiss Army Knife of programming languages.</p><p>Unfortunately, JavaScript wasn't designed for the large scale programs we use it in today. We've had to rely on design patterns, willpower, and luck to mitigate JavaScript's failings. However, there is a better way. TypeScript adds features to JavaScript that make it usable on large scale projects. In this talk, we'll explore TypeScript and how it can be used to tame large scale JavaScript projects. We'll cover some of the important features of TypeScript and how to get started using it in your own projects.</p>",
