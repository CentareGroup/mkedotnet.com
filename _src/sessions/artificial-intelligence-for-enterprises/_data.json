Come learn what happened in 2012 that spurred this recent push.</p><p>What do the high level constructs mean and where do you apply them? What are the various offers from companies like Microsoft, Google, Amazon and IBM? Machine Learning, Deep Neural Networks, Convolutional Neural Network, etc.</p><p>Where can AI fit into your enterprise and how do you get started? Are there prerequisites (code, data, hardware) for it to make sense?</p><p>If you’re asking these questions or have been dabbling with AI, come to this session and help remove some of that fog around this quickly emerging field.</p>",
