        "description": "There’s an obvious problem with diversity in tech, and we talk about it- a lot. It seems to me that we can talk about the problem, and the leaky pipeline and the lack of applicants until we’re blue in the face. Instead of that, let’s talk about actionable ways to lower barriers, reach over, and help people across. I’ll dive into how the Madison Women in Tech, a meetup of a whopping 500 members, reaches its membership, and explore options for mentoring . Last, I’ll dive into how our developers are working on a pro bono development partnership with the pen pal organization, Chins Up, to make mentoring a digital endeavor.",
