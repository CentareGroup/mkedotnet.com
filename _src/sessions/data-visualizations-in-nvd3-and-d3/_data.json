        "description": "<p>We are sitting at the foot of a proliferating pile of data. Making sense of it is a herculean challenge, but there are significant spoils for those who are up to the task. One of the tools at our disposal for making sense of large quantities of data is data visualization. In this talk, we’re going to use web based tools to build amazing visualizations.</p><p>We’ll begin by looking at data visualization best practices. Next, we’ll look at some of the different ways you can visualize data on the web. Then we’ll build charts with NVD3.js. An easy to use tool that supports most charting scenarios. After that, we’ll build complex interactive data visualizations with D3.js, the ultimate visualization power tool.</p><p>After this talk, you’ll have a whole new set of tools to climb to the peak of your own data mountain.</p>",
