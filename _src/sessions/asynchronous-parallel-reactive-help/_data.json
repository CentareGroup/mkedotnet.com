        "description": "<p>The modern world of concurrency can certainly be confusing! This talk is a gentle introduction to the many forms of concurrency. In this talk, you'll learn which types of concurrency are appropriate for which scenarios.</p><p>Most developers have heard of parallelism, so this talk starts with parallel computing, showcasing the Parallel class and Parallel LINQ (PLINQ).</p><p>The next stop is asynchronous code. Asynchronous code is a totally different kind of concurrency than parallel processing, and the async and await keywords enable maintainable asynchronous code in modern applications.</p><p>This talk will also introduce you to TPL Dataflow. A beautiful mix of parallel and asynchronous techniques, TPL Dataflow is a little-known but extremely powerful library.</p><p>The last technology covered is Reactive Extensions. This talk will cover the concepts behind Rx and the most useful operators. This session is entirely practical; the phrase &quot;mathematical dual of IEnumerable&quot; does not appear on any slides.</p>",
