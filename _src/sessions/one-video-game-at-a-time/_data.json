        "description": "<p>There’s no doubt that video games are popular. While some view them as an imagination-sapping waste of time, Acme Nerd Games has a very different perspective: we see games as a means to improve lives. Games engage, teach, and can change behaviors. We believe it’s about time that organizations catch on and deploy the power of games to do good in the communities they serve.</p><p>I’ll share my journey from a seasoned traditional marketer to a business owner that aims to turn what some see as a social pariah into a tool that helps people thrive. I’m not a programmer or game designer, yet I’m leading a development company into new territory. My fresh story will inspire you to follow your passion and seize opportunities.</p>",
