        "description": "<p>Intelligent agents are changing the world we live in. User experience and engagement is expanding from websites and mobile apps to voice services, customer service agents and beyond. This new world opens opportunities that are available to explore. We have access to many of these devices, so why not create a new skill or app to see what they are all about.</p><p>We will be focusing on learning how to create a conversational interface using Amazon Alexa Skills Kit and deploying it out to Lambda. We will also cover the services Amazon offers, Lex and Polly, to add conversational features into your own applications. In the end, you will have a better understanding of intelligent agents and how they are shaping our future, along with having more knowledge around how conversational interfaces work and how to build one yourself.</p>",
