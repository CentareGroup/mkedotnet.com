You will see the basic structure of a Xamarin.Forms app and how to use XAML and the built-in controls to create a UI. You’ll learn about the MVVM pattern and data binding so information can be presented and modified in the UI and app logic layer with ease. You’ll walk through accessing platform specific native controls – from XAML! At the end of this session – you’ll be able to create a beautiful app – make that three beautiful apps – with Xamarin.Forms.</p>",
