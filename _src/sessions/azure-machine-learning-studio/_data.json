        "description": "<p>In this talk I will be presenting on how a user can leverage the Microsoft Azure Machine Learning Studio. I will be covering an unsupervised Machine Learning Algorithm (K-means clustering) as an example. I will cover the basics of k-means to provide a foundation on the algorithm. The talk will demonstrate all aspects of the ML pipeline, from importing your data set, to cleaning it, to training against it. It should provide a solid foundation on how to use the Azure Machine Learning Studio and allow a developer or data scientist to ramp up quickly with their experiments and lay the legwork for running it in production.</p>",
