Sure, there are new framework features and development tools available; but, which of these things are actually worth adopting and when? Should I stick with ASP.NET Web Optimization for bundling & minification, or should I use Gulp? What’s the difference between a tag helper and an HTML helper? Which package manager(s) should I use to acquire the requisite bits and assets? How does the framework support dependency injection for my controllers? Should I target .NET Framework, .NET Core, or both?  Lend me 60 minutes of your time, and I’ll answer these and some other frequently asked questions. You’ll leave with a clearer picture of a practical migration path for your aging MVC application.</p></div></article><article class="scheduleSession"><h1><a href="/sessions/sql-server-performance">What Every Developer Should Know About SQL Server Performance</a></h1><h2><a href="/speakers/david-berry">David Berry</a></h2><h3>Ballroom 2 </h3><div class="hide-small"><p></p><p>Are you mystified by SQL Server performance?  Do you wonder why sometimes your SQL statements runs fast but other times, they run painfully slow?  Do you wish there was a pragmatic set of steps you could go through to troubleshoot performance problems that didn't require you to have a PhD in database internals?  If so, this talk is for you.</p><p>In this talk, I'll describe database performance from a developer's point of view.  I'll show how you can accurately measure the performance of any SQL statement, how to understand what the statement is doing when it runs and what you can do to improve this performance.  I'll show how the right database indexes help SQL Server locate the data your application needs very efficiently and what you need to know to create effective indexes for your application.  Finally, I'll discuss how you can use built in capabilities in SQL Server to find your worst performing statements and tables that are missing indexes so you can quickly find and solve your biggest performance bottlenecks.  At the end of this talk, you will no longer regard database performance as black magic, but instead be able to confidently analyze and solve any performance problems you encounter.</p></div></article><article class="scheduleSession"><h1><a href="/sessions/asynchronous-parallel-reactive-help">Asynchronous?

This talk is a gentle introduction to the many forms of concurrency. In this talk, you'll learn which types of concurrency are appropriate for which scenarios.</p><p>Most developers have heard of parallelism, so this talk starts with parallel computing, showcasing the Parallel class and Parallel LINQ (PLINQ).</p><p>The next stop is asynchronous code. Asynchronous code is a totally different kind of concurrency than parallel processing, and the async and await keywords enable maintainable asynchronous code in modern applications.</p><p>This talk will also introduce you to TPL Dataflow. A beautiful mix of parallel and asynchronous techniques, TPL Dataflow is a little-known but extremely powerful library.</p><p>The last technology covered is Reactive Extensions. This talk will cover the concepts behind Rx and the most useful operators.

However, over the past few years, an entire new ecosystem of platforms for building mobile applications has emerged.</p><p>Xamarin is unique in this space by offering a single language – C#, class library, and runtime that works across all three mobile platforms of iOS, Android, and Windows Phone (Windows Phone’s native language is already C#), while still compiling native (non-interpreted) applications that are performant enough even for demanding games.</p><p>In this talk we'll give an introductory look into what Xamarin is and how you can begin writing cross-platform mobile apps using the language you know and love - C#.</p></div></article></article><article class="timeslot"><h1>Session 2 (11:00 - 12:00)</h1><article class="scheduleSession"><h1><a href="/sessions/chat-ops">Command your environments with ChatOps... /deploy!</a></h1><h2><a href="/speakers/dan-piessens">Dan Piessens</a></h2><h3>Ballroom 1 </h3><div class="hide-small"><p></p><p>&quot;Make it so, number 1!&quot; The ease with which these Star Trek commands are done is an ideal, but environment in which we work isn't nearly as automated! We have development and operations teams cobbling together data from disparate systems, talking to each other with chat streams like Hipchat or Slack and then trying to command complicated infrastructure. This often becomes chaotic during incidents and leads to errors. What if you could capture a piece of that Star Trek world and surface key information, issue key commands and communicate all in a single medium?</p><p>In this talk, I'll explain how to take the chat client you may have today and incorporate it into deployment, monitoring and support streams. We'll cover the basics of infrastructure management and demo how to integrate external tools including a a detailed technical implementation of creating chat command and designing key incoming alerts. I'll also highlight the benefits to your team like integrated security and a single combined source of truth that can be invaluable during retrospectives or critical support situations. Additionally I will cover the common dysfunctions and resolution tips that arise from leveraging a chat tool as a primary information source.

Access the IPrincipal for the current user, call IsInRole(), and you’re done in about 3 lines of code.  It works great…until it doesn’t and then you’re hosed.</p><p>When your application’s user permissions model starts getting complicated, you’ll instantly run into problems with .NET’s role-based security.  The good thing is that it’s not that hard to write your own custom authorization system.</p><p>In this session, we’ll start by discussing what role-based security is all about and what it’s limits are in a typical ASP.NET or WebAPI application.  From there, we’ll start going “off road” to talk about how to design, build, and test custom authorization schemes that handle more complex authorization scenarios.  Along the way, we’ll talk about how to handle tricky details like user administration, creating arbitrary logical groupings of items & users, load testing your security code, and (most importantly) how to make all this code maintainable in the long term.</p></div></article><article class="scheduleSession"><h1><a href="/sessions/information-overload">Dealing with Information Overload and Being More Productive</a></h1><h2><a href="/speakers/scott-hanselman">Scott Hanselman</a></h2><h3>Ballroom 3 </h3><div class="hide-small"><p>As developers, we are asked to absorb even more information than ever before. More APIs, more documentation, more patterns, more layers of abstraction.

That we're all introverts. That we'd rather spend our time interfacing with computers than working with flesh-and-blood humans. Code is logical and predictable. People, by contrast, can feel absolutely chaotic. We're complex, complicated, emotional.</p><p>But software development is an activity performed by people and for people. We have to communicate with humans in myriad ways every day. Improving our communication skills can have a substantial effect on our job performance and satisfaction.</p><p>We'll talk about the importance of good listening and how to get better at it, how to identify and defuse conflict scenarios, and how to level up our influence and persuasiveness.</p></div></article><article class="scheduleSession"><h1><a href="/sessions/magic-mirror">Building a “Magic Mirror”</a></h1><h2><a href="/speakers/david-pine">David Pine</a></h2><h3>Woodfield </h3><div class="hide-small"><p>Have you ever heard of a “magic mirror”?

If you can do it with code, you can probably do it in JavaScript. It's the Swiss Army Knife of programming languages.</p><p>Unfortunately, JavaScript wasn't designed for the large scale programs we use it in today. We've had to rely on design patterns, willpower, and luck to mitigate JavaScript's failings. However, there is a better way. TypeScript adds features to JavaScript that make it usable on large scale projects. In this talk, we'll explore TypeScript and how it can be used to tame large scale JavaScript projects. We'll cover some of the important features of TypeScript and how to get started using it in your own projects.</p></div></article><article class="scheduleSession"><h1><a href="/sessions/azure-functions">Rapid prototyping using Azure Functions - A Walk on the Wild Side</a></h1><h2><a href="/speakers/samrat-saha">Samrat Saha</a></h2><h3>Ballroom 3 </h3><div class="hide-small"><p></p><p>A main focus of mine has been leveraging the Azure platform to help clients explore the possibilities that cloud computing can afford them. Azure has been a great experience and showcases how Microsoft has evolved and matured into a much more open company willing to experiment, fail and succeed with developers and partners.</p><p>This presentation is based on my real world experience of developing with Azure functions to create a prototype for a client that will be entering a pilot launch in select markets.</p><p>A client of ours wanted us to prototype a solution that incorporated SMS using Twilio and NLP using IBM's Watson platform. Furthermore they wanted it to be scalable from the get go. Our initial approach was to use AWS Lambda's but given that our client is heavily into Azure, Azure functions seemed like a natural fit.</p><p>On our way to create the prototype, I quickly discovered the ease with which I could incorporate extremely useful constructs like Queue's and event based triggers and also quickly discovered some of the tooling deficiencies and lack of deeper documentation that could have saved me time and fistful's of hair.</p><p>Along the process of developing the prototype, I engaged heavily with some of the developers at Microsoft who were always willing to help out and also through painful experimentation discovered some techniques that allowed for the system to make sense.</p><p>I would love to share what I have learnt to allow developers to try out this feature of Azure (which I think has great potential for an on-demand scalable compute experience) and also learn from others experiences with the technology and platform. I will outline and describe some of the core technology like triggers, message queues, function chaining, stateless development, shared custom assemblies across functions along with CI/CD hooks  that I used to deliver on the prototype.</p><p>This was done using C# and .NET, but explicit knowledge of C# or .NET is not required, but experience with a higher level language/runtime would help.</p></div></article><article class="scheduleSession"><h1><a href="/sessions/cd-with-visual-studio-team-services">Zero to Continuous Delivery in an Hour with Visual Studio Team Services </a></h1><h2><a href="/speakers/dan-gartner">Dan Gartner</a></h2><h3>Woodfield </h3><div class="hide-small"><p>This demo-paced session will walk attendees through the end-to-end process of creating a Continuous Delivery pipeline using Visual Studio Team Services (VSTS).
