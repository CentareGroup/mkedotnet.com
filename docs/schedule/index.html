Responses to low diversity numbers often include arguments that women and people of color are not applying for these positions, and if they do apply, they are unqualified. This invites two questions: “How can we (non-profits, educational organizations, employers, etc.) ensure the applicants are qualified to get the job?” and “How can employers encourage diversity in employment within their companies once applicants have applied?”</p><p>To address these questions, a local Madisonian organization has created a three-month tech bootcamp, the YWeb Career Academy,that lowers barriers for women and people of color by providing a laptop and free tuition. The bootcamp is modeled after similar programs nationwide whose tuition costs range from $5,000 to $15,000; costs that may prevent interested students from learning the web development and design skills necessary to pursuing a tech career. After program completion, students pursue internships or full-time positions at local companies, with continued program support.</p><p>This presentation will dive into the question of why women and people of color may not be seen as qualified applicants and dig into the root of the issue: barriers to education and employment. During the allotted time, we will also explore practical applications for diversifying employee pools.</p></div></article><article class="scheduleSession"><h1><a href="/sessions/leveraging-open-source">The Impact of Leveraging Open Source</a></h1><h2><a href="/speakers/jeff-strauss">Jeff Strauss</a></h2><h3>Prosperity</h3><div class="hide-small"><p></p><p>Open source tools.

When working in a professional environment, what are our rights and limitations as open source consumers to use, modify, and redistribute these tools? The answer depends upon the OSS author’s own decisions regarding project licensing.

There are many options, and it’s impossible for everyone to know all of them. Traditionally, the choice has been to select which relational database to choose. But with all the NoSql databases available, there are many more choices that may be a better fit for your application. What are the trade offs among all the choices? Why pick just one? I will give some practical examples of how to combine different types of databases. Microsoft released Document DB a couple of years ago, which was their first managed NoSql cloud database. Just recently Cosmos DB has expanded those offerings and made it easier than ever to use. Cosmos DB is a service that contains several types of NoSql databases: Key Value Pair, Document and Graph. I will explain what each of these are, along with some code samples for each one to get you started.

And what in the world is a ‘monad’? In this talk, Jon will walk through the world of the functional programmer and show how these phrases and patterns fit into modern JavaScript development. Jon will work through functions as first class objects in JS, and show how we can use that feature to write clean, maintainable, and reusable code.

While such an environment might enable productivity, it can also distance a developer from important information about how customers use the product. Understanding their experience – how they interact with a product, what they like, what challenges them, even their habits and workstyle – can help you improve functionality and usability.</p><p>During this lively and entertaining session with two learning experience designers in the software industry, find out why and how to connect with customers directly and through customer-facing teams at your organization. This session will give you concrete tips for how to listen to customers, distill feedback, and build relationships inside your organization that can inform development.</p><p>Developers and IT managers will benefit from this session. Regardless of how your organization is structured, considering the point of view of the customer and strengthening cross-team communications will benefit the products you work on, customer satisfaction, and your own career.</p></div></article></article><article class="timeslot"><h1>Session 6 (4:00 - 4:45)</h1><article class="scheduleSession"><h1><a href="/sessions/understanding-sorts">That's not how you pack it! Understanding sorts.</a></h1><h2><a href="/speakers/william-springer">William Springer</a></h2><h3>Clarity</h3><div class="hide-small"><p></p><p>Why handle sorting yourself when your language or framework will do it for you? In most cases, the automatically-provided sort will work just fine, but metadata about the input may allow for a significant performance improvement.</p><p>In this talk, we’ll cover big-O notation (for those who either don’t have a computer science degree or have simply forgotten this part) and then move on to analyzing the asymptotic runtime of various sorting algorithms. We’ll see why mergesort works just fine the majority of the time, but how we can sometimes use a non-comparison sort to greatly boost performance.</p><p>No particular background is required.</p></div></article><article class="scheduleSession"><h1><a href="/sessions/becoming-a-microsoft-mvp">Have Your Best Season Yet: Becoming a (Microsoft) MVP</a></h1><h2><a href="/speakers/lisa-anderson">Lisa Anderson</a></h2><h3>Harmony</h3><div class="hide-small"><p></p><p>Learn how following your passion and deepening your technical area of focus can help you create a wide-sweeping impact and how you can be awarded as an MVP!

Making sense of it is a herculean challenge, but there are significant spoils for those who are up to the task. One of the tools at our disposal for making sense of large quantities of data is data visualization. In this talk, we’re going to use web based tools to build amazing visualizations.</p><p>We’ll begin by looking at data visualization best practices. Next, we’ll look at some of the different ways you can visualize data on the web. Then we’ll build charts with NVD3.js. An easy to use tool that supports most charting scenarios. After that, we’ll build complex interactive data visualizations with D3.js, the ultimate visualization power tool.</p><p>After this talk, you’ll have a whole new set of tools to climb to the peak of your own data mountain.</p></div></article><article class="scheduleSession"><h1><a href="/sessions/orms-and-the-dba">ORMs and the DBA: How to make both happy</a></h1><h2><a href="/speakers/dan-mallott">Dan Mallott</a></h2><h3>Prosperity</h3><div class="hide-small"><p></p><p>Talk to any DBA about ORMs and you’ll quickly find out all the things you like about ORMs are what DBAs don’t like. Interestingly enough, most developers I’ve talked to have issues with their ORMs, too. In this session, we’ll explore why ORMs cause such trouble using examples of bad behavior and poor performance with common application patterns. I’ll outline some strategies for mitigating those troubles such as making sure to audit the generated SQL and changing how we write application code to take advantage of how ORMs attack problems under the hood. Lastly, I’ll introduce some tools (and even yet another ORM) that help solve some of the worst of the problems we see in the database when using ORMs.</p></div></article></article><article class="timeslot"><h1>Happy Hour (4:45 - 6:00)</h1><article class="scheduleSession"><h1><a href="/sessions/happy-hour">Happy Hour &amp; Closing</a></h1><h3>Woodland Dreams Ballroom</h3><div class="hide-small"><p>Join us for happy hour in the Woodland Dreams Ballroom!
